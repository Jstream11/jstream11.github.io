**Stream J, Panellini T, Celement D, Ouseph M. Accelerated macroautophagy in prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis megakaryocytes. Presented at: USCAP 2023 Annual Meeting; 2023 Mar 11-16; New Orleans, LA.**
- Presented poster at 2023 USCAP conference investigating the megakaryocytic microenvironment within prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis patient samples.  
- Investigated the role of autophagy in megakaryopoiesis, thrombopoiesis, and platelet function, with the aim of elucidating its contribution to the development of myeloproliferative neoplasms with megakaryocytic proliferation.
- Utilized multiplex immunofluorescence to assess the presence of autophagy-related proteins, p62 and LC3B, in normal bone marrows and bone marrows from prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis patients. 
- Conducted a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of pre-PMF and normal megakaryocytes, employing the GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler and Whole Human Transcriptome Atlas, with CD61 and CALR protein markers.
- Discovered accelerated macroautophagy in pre-PMF megakaryocytes, implicating its significance in myeloproliferative neoplasms. This finding was supported by significant gene expression differences, particularly in autophagy-related pathways, and backed by visual evidence through immunofluorescence studies.
