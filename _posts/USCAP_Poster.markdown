**Stream J, Panellini T, Celement D, Ouseph M. Accelerated macroautophagy in prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis megakaryocytes. Presented at: USCAP 2023 Annual Meeting; 2023 Mar 11-16; New Orleans, LA.**

Investigated the role of autophagy in megakaryopoiesis, thrombopoiesis, and platelet function, with the aim of elucidating its contribution to the development of myeloproliferative neoplasms with megakaryocytic proliferation. Utilized multiplex immunofluorescence to assess the presence of autophagy-related proteins, p62 and LC3B, in normal bone marrows and bone marrows from prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis patients. Conducted a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of pre-PMF and normal megakaryocytes, employing the GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler and Whole Human Transcriptome Atlas, with CD61 and CALR protein markers. Discovered accelerated macroautophagy in pre-PMF megakaryocytes, implicating its significance in myeloproliferative neoplasms. This finding was supported by significant gene expression differences, particularly in autophagy-related pathways, and backed by visual evidence through immunofluorescence studies.
