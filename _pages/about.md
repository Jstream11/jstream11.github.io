Since my early academic years, I have been driven by an unwavering passion for health equity through science and technology, shaping my undergraduate journey, where I focused on biochemistry, mathematics, and computer science. Graduating from NYU in 2021 with a Bachelor' s degree in Biochemistry, I eagerly sought opportunities to delve deeper into my field. 

I continued to capitalize on my time in New York by acquiring invaluable research skills at Weill Cornell Medical School. My time at Weill Cornell exposed me to a vibrant research environment, where I had the privilege of working alongside seasoned researchers in two distinct laboratories. The first lab investigated hematopoietic malignancies due to myeloproliferative disorders. I actively contributed to mouse colony management and DNA cloning operations, exposing myself to genotyping, primer design, and DNA sequencing. After a year, I transitioned to the Multiparametric In Situ Imaging Laboratory, where I explored the realms of digital pathology, image analysis, and spatial transcriptomics. Working closely with various investigators, I optimized multiplex immunofluorescent antibody panels for tissue staining, leveraging software packages including Akoya-InForm and Indica Labs-HALO for digital image analysis. Additionally, I played a key role in optimizing spatial transcriptomic protocols for the GeoMx platform. These endeavors culminated in the opportunity to present a poster at the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology 2023 Annual Meeting in New Orleans, focusing on the megakaryocytic microenvironment, an experience that solidified my interest in computational biology.

These experiences helped me discover my passion for deciphering the intricate complexities of data and its meaningful application, spurring me to pursue further education and training in bioinformatics.

In my free time, I am often nose-deep in a good book, making my way through every matcha latte and dirty chai at cafes in Boston, and occasionally stumbling upon rare gems while vintage shopping. I also moonlight as a dog sitter, secretly aiming to become the official belly rub champion of the city!
