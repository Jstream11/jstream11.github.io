I started my career nearly 30 years ago at a small Mom-and-Pop computer store building and repairing home computer systems and peripherals.
To put the timing into perspective, we rented parallel CD-ROM drives and CD-ROM based games because the drives were cost prohibitive to the average gamer.
Since then, I've worked in the public and private sectors with 17 years in higher education.
Currently, I am a DevOps engineer for a finance company and use PowerShell and Python daily.

I began scripting or  early.
First playing with batch files in DOS, then DCL (heavily modding the `login.com` for my VMS account) during the few semesters I attended university.
I'm not sure when I began writing VBScript, whether it was at that computer store or my next job at an engineering firm as their systems administrator.
I definitely honed my skill in VBScript while working in my next position at the community college when I started managing login scripts for the Windows NT 3.51 domain.

Around 2009, the college adopted [Microsoft's Live@EDU][Live@EDU]{:target="_blank"}, a predecessor to Exchange Online, to provide students with "free" email and document storage.
The easiest management of this service happened in a PowerShell (version 2) session with a snap-in.
Once I saw the power of PowerShell, I knew that I had to learn more.
And so, I began converting my homegrown identity management system consisting of more than 10,000 lines of VBScript and interfacing with Active Directory, SunOne LDAP, Oracle DB, MySQL, and more.
I enjoyed wowing coworkers (and myself) with the data I could collect and collate using just a few commands of PowerShell.
It has allowed me to control the systems I manage and interface with various others.

I attempt to promote and evangelize PowerShell, helping new learners with the basics and participating in the online community as often as I can.
I am most active on Twitter [@thedavecarroll][MyTwitter]{:target="_blank"}, but you can also find me on [LinkedIn][MyLinkedIn]{:target="_blank"}, in the [PowerShell Forums][PowerShellForums]{:target="_blank"}, and (less occasionally now) in the [r/PowerShell subreddit][PowerShellReddit]{:target="_blank"}.

Note:
I have recently gotten into retrocomputing so you may see some content focused on that.
The first computer I owned was a Commodore 64, but I would spend more time on my Apple //c that I received a couple years later.
My first IBM compatible laptop had an impressive 640K RAM, which I configured part of as a RAM disk, and dual 1.44MB floppy drives.
