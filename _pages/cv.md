### Research Experience ###

**Weill Cornell Medicine --- Multiparametric In Situ Imaging Laboratory**

Research Technician II \| New York, NY \| Oct 2022 - Aug 2023
 
- Optimized spatial transcriptomic protocols for the NanoString GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler platform and RNAScope assay, utilizing various antibodies and tissue types, to achieve reproducible and reliable gene expression results, contributing to the successful completion of multiple research projects.
- Led the validation and optimization of multiplex antibody panels for tissue staining in support of over 20 research projects. Leveraged the automated BondRx Research Stainer and manual techniques to achieve robust and reliable results, significantly accelerating project timelines and ensuring data quality.
- Utilized the Akoya-Vectra Polaris imaging system to capture high-resolution images of stained tissue sections. Employed advanced image analysis software, including Akoya-InForm and Indica Labs-HALO, to extract critical insights.
- Played a pivotal role in the orientation and training of new technical staff. Provided supervision to lower-level laboratory staff, ensuring seamless workflow and adherence to quality standards in a collaborative team environment.

**Weill Cornell Medicine --- Scandura Lab**

Research Technician I \| New York, NY \| Nov 2021 - Oct 2022

- Managed and maintained extensive mouse colonies, supervising mouse husbandry, genotyping, and meticulous record-keeping. Played a key role in optimizing mouse procedures, ensuring the well-being and genetic integrity of research mouse models.
- Performed comprehensive DNA cloning operations, encompassing plasmid design, precision plasmid preparation (including PCR amplification, restriction enzyme digestion, and ligation), transformation, screening, large-scale culturing, and DNA extraction. This resulted in the reliable generation of custom DNA constructs, vital for various research projects.
- Provided critical support in the production of lentiviruses for viral vector-based protein expression, including successful viral vector transfection, efficient harvesting, and optimized purification processes.
- Maintained an accurate and up-to-date inventory of laboratory supplies, equipment, and reagents. Proactively initiated supply orders and meticulously verified deliveries for accuracy, guaranteeing the uninterrupted flow of laboratory operations.

### Presentations ###
 
**United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology**

2023 Annual Meeting, Poster Presentation \| New Orleans, LA \| Mar 2023

Stream J, Panellini T, Clement D, Ouseph M. *Accelerated macroautophagy in prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis megakaryocytes*. USCAP 2023 Abstracts Hematopathology, 1196, Laboratory Investigation, Volume 103, Issue 3, Supplement, 2023, 100106, ISSN 0023-6837, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.labinv.2023.100106.
 
- Investigated the role of autophagy in megakaryopoiesis, thrombopoiesis, and platelet function, with the aim of elucidating its contribution to the development of myeloproliferative neoplasms with megakaryocytic proliferation.
- Utilized multiplex immunofluorescence to assess the presence of autophagy-related proteins, p62 and LC3B, in normal bone marrows and bone marrows from prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis patients.
- Conducted a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of pre-PMF and normal megakaryocytes, employing the GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler and Whole Human Transcriptome Atlas, with CD61 and CALR protein markers.
- Discovered accelerated macroautophagy in pre-PMF megakaryocytes, implicating its significance in myeloproliferative neoplasms. This finding was supported by significant gene expression differences, particularly in autophagy-related pathways, and backed by visual evidence through immunofluorescence studies.
